# Bjuchabrowser
Purpose of this is to create a simple webb browser using pythonista (Totally noob so this will not go easy)
I would like to create a simple webb browser 
Since Im not skilled at all with python (only created simple programs) I thought that I would start learning how to create
inputfields that if you write a URL it will try to open that page
As soon as I have learned that, I will add features
The goal is to have a very simple browser, If only have a textfield where I can enter a URL I will be happy
I know there are other browsers out there, will look at them for inspiration
